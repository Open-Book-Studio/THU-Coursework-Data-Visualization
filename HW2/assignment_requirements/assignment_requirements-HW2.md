> **Assignment 2**

**Issued:** March 15, 2025 **Due:** March 29, 2025

> In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to apply the
> techniques you have learned to create a visualization diagram about
> any topic that interests you.
>
> **Requirements**
>
> 1.1. To get started with this visualization assignment, you need to
> choose a topic first. The topic could be related to your current
> research work, your personal interest, or a news article that you care
> about. If you're having trouble finding a topic, we have provided two
> additional datasets for you to choose from. Please refer to the
> Section \"Additional provided datasets\" for more information.
>
> 1.2. You are required to create **at least two visualization graphs**
> for the dataset related to your chosen topic.
>
> The purpose of these graphs is to effectively convey **different
> aspects** of the impor- tant information related to your chosen topic.
> Take the additional provided dataset
>
> -- \"National Football League (NFL) Play-by-Play Data\" for example,
> you could cre- ate the first graph that depicts the relationship
> between the success of a team and the presence of star players. Then,
> you could create the second graph that reflects the rise and fall of
> each team over time, providing insights into which teams have been
> most successful historically.
>
> Please note that this assignment places a strong emphasis on
> "Creativity\". There- fore, it is advisable to avoid just using simple
> plot charts or scatter plots. Instead, please explore more advanced
> visualization techniques and tools to present your data in an engaging
> and innovative manner. Be sure to push the boundaries of your
> creativity while maintaining a clear and concise representation of
> your findings.
>
> 1.3. You are required to write a **report** with a description and
> interpretation of your
>
> graph. The report should contain, at minimum, the following
> information:
>
> \(a\) An introduction of your chosen topic.
>
> \(b\) A description of the dataset you are using, including
> attributes, types, and other relevant information.
>
> \(c\) The graphs you created for this visualization task.
>
> \(d\) A description of your graph that explains what it represents,
> the data it dis- plays, and the insights it provides. This section
> should highlight any important features or trends that are visible in
> the graph.
>
> \(e\) An explanation of the visual encoding techniques used in your
> graph. This section should detail how you achieved the visual
> representation of your data, including the choice of colors, sizes,
> shapes, and other design elements.
>
> 1.4. In addition to writing a report, you are also required to prepare
> for an **oral pre-**
>
> **sentation** to showcase your work. Please note the following
> instructions:
>
> \(a\) Your presentation should be no longer than **3 minutes**. Please
> practice your presentation to ensure that you are able to convey all
> of the necessary infor- mation within this time frame.
>
> \(b\) You should prepare a **one-page slide** to accompany your
> presentation. This slide should include the graphs you have created as
> well as any other key information you would like to highlight.
>
> \(c\) During your presentation, at least one question will be asked by
> the professor or your classmates. Please be prepared to provide a
> clear and complete answer to the question.
>
> The exact presentation time has not been decided yet. We will inform
> you as soon as we have more information on the schedule.
>
> 1.5. It is important to be transparent about any external resources
> used in completing an assignment. If you have discussed the assignment
> with anyone or used any large language models, such as ChatGPT, Github
> Copilot, or BLOOM, please specify how you used the external
> resource(s) - for example, did you use them to brainstorm ideas, write
> code, or proofread your work? If you have completed the homework
> unaided, please state that explicitly in your report by saying, \"I
> have completed this homework unaided. \"
>
> **Submission**

To ensure that your submission is complete and easy to manage, please
make sure to follow these guidelines:

> 1.1. Your submission should consist of two parts: **the programming
> part** and **the report part** (Both Chinese and English are
> acceptable). Please compress both parts into a single .zip format
> file, which should be named using the following format: **'\[Your
> Name\]\_\_\[Your Student Number\].zip'**.
>
> 1.2. The report should be integrated into a single PDF file, named
> 'report.pdf' . Please make sure to put this file outside of the
> appendix part folder, so it's easy to locate.
>
> 1.3. The appendix should be placed in a folder named \"Visualization
> Appendix.\" This folder should contain all of your code, slides, and
> other appendix files.
>
> 1.4. To ensure that your file is easy to upload and download, please
> limit the size of your uploaded file to no more than 50MB.
>
> **Grading**

**Important!** Your homework will be graded based on the following
criteria:

> • Completeness (40%): Have you completed the visualization tasks using
> your chosen visualization tools? Have you provided a description and
> interpretation for your topic and graph in the report? Have you
> successfully presented your work in a clear and concise manner?
>
> • Clarity(30%): Have you made your graphs easy to read and understand?
> Have you used appropriate colors, sizes, shapes, and legends to
> distinguish different elements on your graphs? Have you added
> informative titles and labels to your graphs? Have you provided a
> well-prepared presentation, or given a thoughtful answer to the
> presentation problem?
>
> • Creativity(30%): Have you gone beyond the minimum requirements of
> the assign- ment to create a particularly engaging design? Have you
> used creative approaches to visualize your data and convey your
> message effectively?

**Additional provided datasets**

> • National Football League (NFL) Play-by-Play Data
>
> NFL Play-by-Play Data is an opensource dataset that provides National
> Football League (NFL) play-by-play data. This dataset contains all the
> regular season plays from the 2009-2018 NFL seasons. Each play is
> broken down into great detail contain- ing information on: game
> situation, players involved, results, and advanced metrics such as
> expected point and win probability values. It facilitates the
> researchers to carry out modern and reproducible research in football
> analytics. Here, you are encouraged to explore this dataset and try to
> discover some interesting phenomena or make some reliable predictions
> at player/game levels.

> • High Spatial-Temporal Resolution of PM2.5 Measurement
>
> S&M-HSTPM2d5 is an open-source dataset for anyone interested in
> researching air pollution in Chinese cities Foshan, Cangzhou, and
> Tianjin. This open-source dataset offers high spatial-temporal
> resolution PM2.5 measurements, complete with timestamps and GPS
> locations of both mobile and static devices. Researchers can use this
> data to create fine-grained city-scale air pollution maps, providing
> critical environmental insights for city managers and residents alike.
> By leveraging this information, city managers can make informed
> decisions when it comes to planning, managing, and developing their
> cities. Meanwhile, residents can use this data to steer clear of
> polluted areas and reduce their exposure to harmful pollutants.

> **Important!** Please note that if you decide to use this dataset --
> the same dataset as you did in Assignment 1, please avoid using the
> same graphs or visualizations that you used in Assignment 1. We
> encourage you to explore new ways to visualize the data and discover
> new insights that may not have been uncovered in your previous
> assignment.
